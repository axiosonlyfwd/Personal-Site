description: Trends and technologies I enjoy following and think will positively impact the future.
---

Keeping a list on trends + technologies I'm personally inspired by, optimistic about, and potentially want to work on in the future.

### **Tech + Startups**
I grew up near the bay but wasn't really exposed to tech and startups until college. I got obsessed with reading stuff on early Quora and figured it'd be more exciting to try building new things for the world instead of pushing numbers around aimlessly in finance.

### **AI, ML, and Data**
My first gig out of college was at Amazon working on analytics and I'm not sure why but I fell deeply in love with pulling data with SQL, figuring out what's going through analytics, and I have a lot of fun making predictions about things (for fun or in actual systems).

### **Crypto**
Basically all of my time growing up was spent on internet forums like Niketalk, Superfuture, and Hypebeast reading about streetwear and sneakers, playing video games like DotA (Allstars*), managing fantasy basketball and football teams, or just shitposting on Tumblr. Speculation aside, crypto reminds me of my childhood on the internet. Collecting is fun. Open, transparent, and permissionless applications and data are good for the world.

### **Health, Fitness, Longevity**
Pushing the limits of the human body and living longer is good for the world. Eliud Kipchoge and Lebron James are major inspirations.

### **Housing, Urbanism, and Cities**
Living in dense cities and being closer to my friends makes me happy. Suburban sprawl is bad for climate. Owning a car feels like a waste of money.
