### Startups I'd like to see in the world
Running list of startup ideas for things I think would be fun or interesting to build and have in the world.

#### **"Impact" Graph or "Sorting Hat"**

It bums me out that social media companies have perfected ML to hack our generation's attention and hook them on addicting but often unuseful content in exchange for ads.
- It's also hard for people to identify the intersection of what's meaningful to them + what's useful for the world.
- Inspired by <a href="https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2020/8/3/tiktok-and-the-sorting-hat">Eugene Wei's essay on TikTok creating the "interest" graph</a>, I'd love to see an "impact" graph of curated entertaining and informative content and job opportunities vertically focused around things that are positively impactful for the world.
- Imagine something like <a href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a> which helps people navigate impactful world problems but less pessimistic and making use of better content, recommendation engines, and opportunities.

#### **Living closer with friends and community**

General problem statement of making it seamless to find or build housing together with your friends, family, and general community as means of reducing loneliness + improving long-term happiness. 
- Easiest MVP could just be an opt-in "find my" type app to know address or general vicinity of where your close friends live to keep in mind.
- Next up might be a group search, filter, and bookmarking experience layered on top of Google Maps, MLS data, and homebuilder data. Social alternative to Zillow + Streeteasy.
- Most ambitious would be collaboratively finding land, sourcing developers and home designs, shopping leads to
homebuilders, and building out sections of cities from scratch.

#### **Web3 Tumblr**

Fun and easy way to collect your favorite things on internet and share it with friends. Less professional and performative vibes than current social media but more authentic, fun, and vulnerable.
