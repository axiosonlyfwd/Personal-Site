description: About Frank Lee.

**Personally, I'm a dorky, curious human**. I'm a Bay Area bred and proud public school kid (go Bruins!) residing in NYC. I geek out about marathon training, hip-hop and r&b music, streetwear, and cocktail mixing. I might also guiltily binge trash tv and anime every once in a while.

**Professionally, I like operating in startups and trying out new things.** I’m taking a brief sabbatical to learn programming and explore what I’m intrinsically motivated about. I’ve led product, operations, and analytics teams at Dapper Labs (NBA Top Shot and NFL ALL DAY), Hoist (empowering entrepreneurs to start SMB’s), and Opendoor (pricing homes and home portfolio management). I started my ride at Amazon where I developed my first love language: data-driven decision making and operational planning.

**This is my weird home on the internet.** The main purpose of this space is be more comfortable thinking out loud, share my favorite content that I run into, and develop a serendipity machine to meet others on the internet. If you ever want to link, hit me up!
