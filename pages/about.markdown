description: About Frank Lee.

**Personally, I’m a dorky, curious human**. I’m a Bay Area bred and proud public school kid (go Bruins!) currently residing in NYC. I geek out about marathon training, hip-hop and r&b music, streetwear and sneakers, and cocktail mixing. I might also guiltily binge trash dating shows and anime every once in a while.

**Professionally, I like operating in startups and trying out new things.** I’m on a brief sabbatical to recharge, learn programming for fun, and explore spaces I’m more intrinsically motivated about. I’ve led product, operations, and analytics teams at Dapper Labs ([NBA Top Shot](https://nbatopshot.com/) and [NFL ALL DAY](https://nflallday.com/)), [Hoist](https://www.withhoist.com/) (empowering entrepreneurs to start SMB’s), and [Opendoor](https://opendoor.com/) (pricing homes and portfolio management). I started my career working on analytics at Amazon where I developed my love language in data. If you want to learn more about my work, [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14hGY1fw_HIG1MvW8e1P0L_1rtu3m6ESD/view?usp=sharing)! 

**This is meant to be my weird home on the internet.** The main purpose of this space is be more comfortable thinking out loud, share my favorite content that I run into, and develop a serendipity machine to meet others on the internet. If you ever want to link, hit me up!

And for those that don't know: knarfeel is franklee *backwards*.
