Quick primer on myself and my personality, working patterns, and communication preferences.

### Personality Profiles
My favorite "astrology sign" personality frameworks ☺️
- **Ennegream**: [Type 5 - Investigator](https://personalitypath.com/enneagram/type-5-personality/) (Curious, Independent, Detached)
- **Myers-Briggs (MBTI)**: [ENTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality) (**E**xtroverted I**N**tuition **T**hinking **J**udging)
- **Love Lanuages**
	- **Likes**: Quality Time > Touch > Words of Affirmation
	- **Dislikes**: Acts of Service < Gifts 


### **Values**
- **Open Mindedness**: I make decisions with conviction but I'm always open minded to data that suggests a better way. If I receive solid reasoning or data, I'll change course quickly.
- **["Yes, and..."](https://medium.com/improv4/saying-yes-and-a-principle-for-improv-business-life-fd050bccf7e3)**: I love this improv principle for pushing me to keep an open ear to ideas from other, assuming the best intent, and trying to constructively build on top.
- **Curiosity and Growth Mindset:** I enjoy learning, being exposed to a wide spectrum of disciplines, and I'm in the process of figuring out where I want to get extremely deep in.
- **Resourceful Action**: I want to learn the most from experimenting proactively instead of debating concepts into oblivion. If it doesn't work, be resourceful and figure out how.
- **Sweat the Details**: [Opendoor's *BPS for breakfast* principle](https://twitter.com/justindross/status/1308105815358803968?lang=en) pushed us to uncover savings from every inch of a line item and I'm inspired to sweat the details in my life as well.
- **[Obligation to Dissent](http://workingwithmckinsey.blogspot.com/2013/11/Obligation-to-Dissent.html)**: If you disagree with something, you should be obligated to speak your mind, regardless of source or hierarchy, if you think it'll help. 
- **Deep and Authentic Friendships**: The best part of all my work experiences were friends gained along the way. I want to be empathetic, authentic, and build genuine friendships.


### **Things I spike on**
- **Working with data**. I love SQL, building dashboards, hacking spreadsheets.
- **Structuring ambiguity**. I've had to assemble order from chaos in a lot of startups. It's also fun turning experiments into systems and making things repeatable through playbooks.
- **Systems thinking**. I like figuring out the [system equation](https://medium.com/venture-desktop/the-business-equation-f270aca5164) for whatever I'm working on, building measurable framework for it, then being thoughtful about how each lever or input affects components around it.
- **Bias for action over theory**. I hate arguing for long about theories and find a lot more joy in launching, getting empirical proof on whether something works, learning, and doing it again.
- **Ownership**. I like trying new things and taking on new responsibilities. I've excelled as a generalist thus far, owning many things, and trying to do what's best for the team.
