Quick primer on myself, my personality, and how to work with me (working patterns and communication preferences). If you have something similar, I'd love to read as well!


### Personality Profiles
I think personality tests are more reflective of how someone wants to be perceived rather than how they actually act. But I do think they're useful and it's fun to share ☺️
- **Ennegream**: [Type 5 - Investigator](https://personalitypath.com/enneagram/type-5-personality/) (Curious, Independent, Detached)
- **Myers-Briggs (MBTI)**: [ENTJ](https://www.16personalities.com/entj-personality) (**E**xtroverted I**N**tuition **T**hinking **J**udging)
- **Love Lanuages**
	- **Likes**: Quality Time > Touch > Words of Affirmation
	- **Dislikes**: Acts of Service < Gifts 


### **Values**
- **Open Mindedness**: I make decisions with conviction but I'm always open minded to data that suggests a better way. If I receive solid reasoning or data, I'll change course quickly.
- **["Yes, and..."](https://medium.com/improv4/saying-yes-and-a-principle-for-improv-business-life-fd050bccf7e3)**: I love this improv principle for pushing me to keep an open ear to ideas from other, assuming the best intent, and trying to constructively build on top.
- **Curiosity and Growth Mindset:** I enjoy learning, being exposed to a wide spectrum of disciplines, and I'm in the process of figuring out where I want to get extremely deep in.
- **Action and Resourcefulness**: I want to learn most from experimenting proactively instead of debating concepts into oblivion. If it doesn't work, be resourceful and figure out how to improve.
- **Sweat the Details**: [Opendoor's *BPS for breakfast* principle](https://twitter.com/justindross/status/1308105815358803968?lang=en) pushed us to uncover savings from every inch of a line item and I'm inspired to sweat the details in my life as well.
- **[Obligation to Dissent](http://workingwithmckinsey.blogspot.com/2013/11/Obligation-to-Dissent.html)**: If you disagree with something, you should be obligated to speak your mind, regardless of source or hierarchy, if you think it'll help. 
- **[Disagree and Commit](https://hackernoon.com/disagree-and-commit-the-importance-of-disagreement-in-decision-making-b31d1b5f1bdc)**: Somewhat of a counter-pair with obligation to dissent. There's a time for deciding and a time for action. Once the decision is made, I'll try my best to make it work regardless of whether I agreed beforehand.
- **Deep and Authentic Friendships**: The best part of all my work experiences were friends gained along the way. I want to be empathetic, authentic, and build genuine friendships.


### **Things I spike on**
- **Working with data**. I love SQL, building dashboards, hacking spreadsheets.
- **Structuring ambiguity**. I've had to assemble order from chaos in a lot of startups. It's also fun turning experiments into systems and making things repeatable through playbooks.
- **Systems thinking**. I like figuring out the [system equation](https://medium.com/venture-desktop/the-business-equation-f270aca5164) for whatever I'm working on, building measurable framework for it, then being thoughtful about how each lever or input affects components around it.
- **Bias for action over theory**. I hate arguing for long about theories and find a lot more joy in launching, getting empirical proof on whether something works, learning, and doing it again.
- **Ownership**. I like trying new things and taking on new responsibilities. I've excelled as a generalist thus far, owning many things, and trying to do what's best for the team.


### **Things I'm working on improving**
- **Consistently operating long-term**. When I'm in the thick of a project, I can get bogged down by day-to-day fires and not allocate enough space and time to think long-term.
- **Responsiveness**. A byproduct of not believing in multi-tasking and silencing notifications. I've had a recent habit of seeing messages and not always responding. It's a key focus this year.
- **Analysis paralysis personal projects**. Ironically, I have immense bias for action for work but have tended to procrastinate on personal projects. When there's too many options, I can catch analysis paralysis. Also a key focus this year to get over by shipping more experiments.


### **Communication**
- I've killed push notifications on email, Slack, and Discord but do allocate time to review daily. I’ll only respond if you ask me something directly or I have a question. If you don't get a response in 12 hours but think I owe you a response, just ping me again.
- I like working on my own schedule, that means I might ping you at random times. That ***does not*** mean I expect a response. Unless explicit, just respond the next day.
- I try my best to batch work as much as possible, so my schedule is structured around that. I block time in the morning and after dinner for individual work. Otherwise I try to have all meetings back to back continuously if possible. 
- Comments are easy. Answers are expensive. If I comment on your doc, I'm just trying to provide a helpful input but please don't feel obligated to answer me. 
- If it can be a [Loom](https://loom.com/), please send me a Loom instead of a live meeting. 
- I love FYI updates - any useful tidbits about things you're working on, customer anecdotes, interesting or useful articles or data. I don't get overwhelmed with comms if I'm not obligated to respond to everything so share away!


### **I do my best work when**
- I'm more intrinsically driven when I think the projects I'm working on are impactful for the org and definitively are beneficial for the world. It's even more meaningful if I feel we're launching things quickly and effectively. Walk me through the why.
- Possibly my biggest goal as an operator and leader is to encourage teammates to be themselves. As long as you’re not hurting others or impacting your work, I want to support you showing up as you. 
- I like getting docs ahead of time so I can think about things on my own and not have to live process everything.
- I hate having to read between the lines and always prefer not make others do that either. I'm a believer that more transparent and plugged-in teams execute more effectively and happily.
- I want visibility into how I'm doing, what's going well or not well, and ensuring I have actionable steps to get to the next level. I love receiving feedback, especially when it's honest and constructive. Tell me what I need to know, not what you think I want to hear.


### **What drains me**
- I don't mind being micro-managed if the asks I'm receiving are logically sound or grounded in solid user research + data since I know I'm learning. I get drained when my teams get asked to work on things impetuously without data or the context on why.
- If something is heading off the rails, tell me before the crash. Failure is great if you learn something valuable from it. Surprises that impact others are not.
- The feeling or actual presence of office politics over merit in decision making.
