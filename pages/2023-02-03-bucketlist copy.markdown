### **[P0] Health 🏃🏻‍♂️🧠**

- **Improving Attention**: Go for walks, workouts, or writes whenever I catch myself doomscrolling. Use SelfControl app and just remove Youtube, Netflix, and games. Maybe get a [Light Phone](https://www.thelightphone.com/) for the work week.
- **Improving Mental Health**: be softer on myself when I’m unproductive or my mood and motivation are in the gutter. Have less imposter syndrome. Try to understand what I’m nervous about and avoiding when I procrastinate.
- **Running**: rediscover the fun and gratifying feeling of progress here; 40/mi week. Maybe stop listening to podcasts on runs and just focus on pace.
- **Lifting**: Try and do this 2x weekly to not get too small; take more protein

### **[P0] Personal Projects 💻**

- **Programming**: Finish the full-stack CodeAcademy class by end of January. Make a git commit daily for the rest of the year.
    - Build a personal website.
    - Create a LLM workflow app for myself.
    - Build the live near friends mobile app.
    - Build a web3 tumblr clone for fun.
- **Finding My Voice**: Settle my love-hate relationship with social media. No browsing or lurking. Don’t have apps on phone, download only to post, and set a dedicated hour in the night to write and respond in earnest. Figure out the basics on building an audience.
    - Instead of surface-level browsing, do deep-dives into topics I’m curious about and write it up.
    - Openly ruminate on problems I’m seeing and whether there’s something to build there.
- **Explore**: Just hack on things personally fun to get better at programming and sharing and have zero pressure to start something official. I need to get better with unstructured time.
    - Figure out how to make the stakes feel close to zero and frictionless to get started.

### **[P1] Life + Dating 💯💘**

- **Get Engaged**: make it meaningful for Lisa and myself! Probably get paper married and map out our life plan (where to move to, wedding planning, kid planning, saving for a house, etc.)
- **Dates**: a date a week in our last year in NYC. Actually really like the intention of curating 50 great 1st date activities in NYC, asking personal questions, and creating a shareable + marketable list.
- **Respond**: If I see a text, just respond immediately. Same with emails that require my attention. Unsubscribe from stuff that does not bring me joy.
- **Finances**: Be smarter about foundational expenses like rent, discretionary spend, and no aping into ponzi assets this year to save.

### **[P2] Work 💼**

- I think I just want to find a job that is worth it from an income per hour worked perspective this time - ideally something I could do in 20-30 hours per week so I can work on other things and be happier outside of work.
- Secondarily, in a growing foundational industry worth staying in long-term
    - Are there things that I think should exist long-term that are good for the world?
    - AI, space + manufacturing, internet/SaaS, non-speculative web3, socioeconomic mobility
- Take the cash and not the equity this time.
